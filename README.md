🎓 WPF Student Management System
A desktop application built with C# and WPF for a semester project. This app provides a complete solution for managing student data, from creation to deletion, all wrapped in a modern, responsive Material Design interface.

✨ Features
Modern, Responsive UI: Built using the Material Design in XAML library for a professional look and feel.

Full CRUD Functionality:

Create: Add new students to the database.

Read: View all students in a sortable, filterable DataGrid.

Update: Select any student to load their data into a form for editing.

Delete: Remove students from the database.

Data Persistence: Uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to connect to a local SQLite database, so all data is saved between sessions.

Clean MVVM Architecture: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the code testable and maintainable.

Data Validation: Includes logic to validate user input (e.g., ensuring required fields are filled and GPA is in a valid range).
